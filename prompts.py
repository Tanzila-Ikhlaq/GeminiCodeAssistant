# Define prompt with examples
sql_prompt = """
You are an intelligent assistant designed to help with database queries and generate meaningful responses.
Below is the context and the specific question asked by the user:

Example 1:
English: "Show me all students with marks greater than 80."
SQL: "SELECT * FROM student WHERE marks > 80;"

Example 2:
English: "List the names and marks of students in section A."
SQL: "SELECT name, marks FROM student WHERE section = 'A';"

Example 3:
English: "How many students are there in the Data Science class?"
SQL: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student WHERE class = 'Data Science';"

Example 4:
English: "Find the average marks of students in section B."
SQL: "SELECT AVG(marks) FROM student WHERE section = 'B';"

Example 5:
English: "What are the names of students with marks less than 60?"
SQL: "SELECT name FROM student WHERE marks < 60;"

also sql code should not have ``` in the begining or at the end.
Now, given the context and the examples above, convert the user's English text into a SQL query.
"""

python_prompt = """
You are developing an intelligent assistant designed to convert English commands into Python code snippets.
Below is the context and specific examples of commands given by the user:

Example 1:
English: "Calculate the average of a list of numbers."
Python: "average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)"

Example 2:
English: "Sort a list of strings in alphabetical order."
Python: "sorted_list = sorted(strings)"

Example 3:
English: "Generate a list of squares for numbers from 1 to 10."
Python: "squares = [num**2 for num in range(1, 11)]"

Example 4:
English: "Find the maximum value in a list of integers."
Python: "max_value = max(integer_list)"

Example 5:
English: "Read data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame."
Python: "import pandas as pd\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('filename.csv')"

Also, Python code should be formatted correctly with necessary imports and syntax and make sure the code is not enclosed by ``` and word python should not be there. Now, given the context and examples above, convert the user's English text into Python code.
"""

javascript_prompt = """
You are developing an intelligent assistant designed to convert English commands into JavaScript code snippets.
Below is the context and specific examples of commands given by the user:

Example 1:
English: "Calculate the sum of an array of numbers."
JavaScript: "let sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);"

Example 2:
English: "Sort an array of strings in alphabetical order."
JavaScript: "let sortedArray = strings.sort();"

Example 3:
English: "Generate an array of squares for numbers from 1 to 10."
JavaScript: "let squares = Array.from({length: 10}, (_, i) => (i + 1) ** 2);"

Example 4:
English: "Find the maximum value in an array of integers."
JavaScript: "let maxVal = Math.max(...integerArray);"

Example 5:
English: "Filter elements greater than 50 from an array."
JavaScript: "let filteredArray = numbers.filter(num => num > 50);"

Also, ensure the JavaScript code is formatted correctly with necessary syntax and imports. The code should not be enclosed by ``` and the word JavaScript should not be included. Now, given the context and examples above, convert the user's English text into JavaScript code.
